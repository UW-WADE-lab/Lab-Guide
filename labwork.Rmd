## W.A.D.E. Lab Genetics Program {-}

The W.A.D.E. Lab shares genetics laboratory space with the SAFS MERLab, which is jointly run by Drs. [Lorenz Hauser](https://fish.uw.edu/faculty/lorenz-hauser/) ([Marine Population Genomics Lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/lhauser/wordpress/)) and [Kerry Naish](https://fish.uw.edu/faculty/kerry-naish/) ([Applied Evolutionary and Ecological Genetics Lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/knaish/)). The lab occupies rooms 271, 276, and 277 on the second floor of the Marine Studies building ([MAR](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Marine+Studies+Building+(MAR)/@47.6525504,-122.3156089,19z/data=!3m1!5s0x549014f1fcfb9d01:0xc96981eca3b78cce!4m6!3m5!1s0x549014f1fced4987:0xc612428a54e06427!8m2!3d47.6524713!4d-122.314939!16s%2Fg%2F1hm4zq649?entry=ttu))

## Genetics Lab Safety Training {-}

Any member of the W.A.D.E. Lab who uses the genetics laboratory facilities must first complete a lab orientation and safety training, consisting of an in-person walk-through of the lab spaces and several online training courses. Please read this entire page carefully before scheduling an in-person orientation with Amy.

Once you have completed the online training courses and the in-person orientation to the MERLab spaces, please complete and sign the UW [Lab Employee Safety Training Record](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/lab-employee-safety-train-checklist.docx), and email a copy to Amy.

### UW Lab Safety Resources

The UW Environmental Health and Safety Office maintains several helpful lab safety resources. It will be helpful for you to familiarize yourself with each of these; you can always refer back to them when you have specific lab safety questions.

1. [UW EH&S Laboratory Safety Program Office](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/research-lab/laboratory-safety)
2. [UW Lab Safety Manual - December 2023 edition](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/lsm.pdf)
3. [UW EH&S Training Courses](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/training-course-selection-guides)

### Required Online Training

The required online training courses will depend what work each person is doing. In general, most people conducting genetic work in the MERLab will need the following three courses, at a minimum:

1. [Fire Extinguisher Training - Online](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/fire-extinguisher-training-online)
2. [Managing Laboratory Chemicals - Online](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/managing-laboratory-chemicals-online)
3. [Eyewashes and Safety Showers - Online](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/eyewashes-and-safety-showers)

Once you have completed these training courses, you should see them appear on your list of completed training courses on the [UW EH&S Training Records](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training-records) site within 1-2 business days. When you meet with Amy, discuss with her whether your anticipated labwork would require any additional UW EH&S training.

### MERLab Safety Equipment Locations

1. **Fire alarms and extinguishers** - there are three (3) fire alarms in the MERLab. The first is located in the lobby at the top of the main stairwell. The second is located next to the elevators, and the third is located between MAR 274 and MAR 277. Two (2) fire extinguishers are co-located with the second and third fire alarms.
2. **Emergency Showers** - there are two (2) emergency showers in the MERLab hallway, one outside 271 and another outside 277. These are checked monthly to ensure functionality.
3. **Eyewash Stations** - each lab space has an eyewash station at one of the sinks. In MAR 271, the eyewash station is located in the sink in the aDNA area. In MAR 274, the eyewash station is located in the sink closest to the south door. In MAR 277, the eyewash station is located in the backmost sink.
4. **Evacuation Routes** - Emergency exits are located at both the south and north ends of the MERLab hallway.
5. **Material Safety Data Sheets and Standard Operating Procedures** - MSDSs and SOPs for all chemicals stored in the lab can be found in MAR 274, on the shelf above the lab bench on the south wall.
6. **Chemical Spill Kit** - A chemical safety spill kit is located by the north door in MAR 276.
7. **First Aid Kit** - A first aid kit is located in MAR 274 at the east end of the center lab bench.

### Emergency Contact Numbers

Emergency contact numbers can be found inside the door of each MERLab space (MAR 271, 274, and 277). In an emergency, contact any of the following:

<center>

```{r, fig.align = "center", echo=FALSE}
library(pander)

contacts <- data.frame(Name = c("Amy Van Cise", "Lorenz Hauser", "Kerry Naish"), Role = c("W.A.D.E. Lab PI", "MERLab PI", "MERLab PI"), Phone = c("781-686-6753", NA, NA))

pander(contacts)
```

</center>

### Exposure Limits

Expsoure limits for hazardous materials can be found on their MSDSs, stored in MAR 274 above the lab bench on the south wall.

### Personal Protective Equipment

Anyone working in any genetics lab is required to use personal protective equipment, both for their own protection as well as for the protection of the samples. While in the lab, always use a lab coat and nitrile gloves. **Note:** *Lab coats should not leave the lab in which they are located, do NOT wear lab coats in the hallway between labs or in another lab space. Similarly, nitrile gloves should not be transferred between labs.*

**Lab coats** can be found in each lab space. In MAR 271, they are located XXXX. In MAR 274, they are located by the north door. In MAR 277, they are located by the back sink.

**Nitrile gloves** can be found in MAR 271 by the door, in MAR 274 by the south door, and in MAR 277 by XXXX.

### Equipment Safety

Proper technique is important to ensure safety while using MERLab equipment. SOPs for specialized MERLab equipment can be found in the W.A.D.E. lab's [Genetic Lab SOPs folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/180tIs4EQgK9JZVMmZvN0ap2sO8C149bk?usp=sharing).

Special considerations include:

1. Centrifuges: always ensure centrifuges are properly balanced, and double-check that the lid is tightly sealed before running the centrifuge.
2. PCR machines: always ensure the top lid is sealed before running a PCR machine.
3. XXX

### Chemical Safety

While working in the MERLab, you may come in contact with potentially harmful chemicals. SOPs for MERLab chemicals can be found in the W.A.D.E. lab's [Genetic Lab SOPs folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/180tIs4EQgK9JZVMmZvN0ap2sO8C149bk?usp=sharing). MSDS sheets for all chemicals are located in the pre-PCR lab (MAR 274) above the lab bench on the south wall.

The most common potentially harmful chemicals are:

1. **EtOH (ethanol):** Ethanol may be found in dilutions of 100%, 95%, or 70%. 100% ethanol is flammable and can be an irritant to the eyes or skin. It can also affect the respiratory tract if breathed for a long period of time. Safety information for ethanol can be found [here](https://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/89308.htm). If you come in contact with ethanol, rinse the affected area thoroughly (e.g. eyewash station for eyes or soap and water on skin). Store 100% ethanol in the chemical storage cabinet beneath the north fume hood in MAR 276. Ethanol waste should be disposed of by **XXXXX.**

2. **Bleach:** Bleach may be found in dilutions of 100% or ~10%. 100% bleash is corrosive and can cause eye and skin burns. It is also harmful if inhaled. Safety information for bleach can by found [here](https://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/91020.htm). If you come in contact with ethanol, rinse the affected area thoroughly (e.g. eyewash station for eyes or soap and water on skin). Store 100% bleach in a tighly sealed container, in the cabinet below sinks and away from other chemicals. Bleach can be disposed of by **pouring down the sink while diluting with plenty of running water**.

### Chemical storage

All chemicals, including dilutions, must be properly labeled with the chemical makeup (e.g. 95% EtOH/ethanol), date, and proper chemical labels. All chemicals must be stored at or below eye level, on a shelf with edge support. 

1. **EtOH (ethanol)** is stored in MAR 274, in the chemical cabinet underneath the fume hood located at the north end of the room. 
2. **Acids** are stored in the chemcal cabinet underneath the fume head next to the millipore sink (MAR XXX). 
3. **Bases** are stored in the cabinets beneath the lab bench in MAR XXX.

### Glassware storage

All glassware must be stored on a shelf with edge support. Glassware storage for each lab space is:

1. MAR271:
2. MAR274 (pre-PCR): along north wall.
3. MAR277: 

## Genetics Lab Orientation {-}

### MERLab spaces

The MERLab is divided into three main areas to minimize contamination: (1) a DNA extraction lab (MAR 271), (2) a pre-PCR lab (MAR 274), and (3) a post-PCR lab (MAR 277). Genetic material and an equipment or supplies should only move in the direction 1-2-3 and never backwards. Once something has left the pre-PCR lab, for example, it can only go to the post-PCR lab and never return to the DNA extraction lab or pre-PCR lab. *Note that it is generally not advised to bring lab notebooks in and out of lab spaces.*

### Post-PCR Lab (MAR 277)

INFO ON POST-PCR LAB HERE

### Fridge and Freezer Facilities

Various freezers and refidgerators are available for temporary storage of genetics materials and reagents. These include:

1. MAR 271:
2. MAR 274:
3. MAR 277:

### -80C Freezer Safety

Note that objects frozen in ultracold (-80C) freezers will cause burns that can damage your skin if you come into direct contact with them. *Always* use thermal gloves when accessing these freezers. 

When done accessing an ultracold freezer, ensure that all inner and outer doors are completely closed and properly latched.

### Use of Consumables

The MERLab is run as a cost center, which allows its member labs to combine orders and reduce waste and additional expenses. The use of certain consumables is covered by a monthly fee to the MERLab; e.g. gloves, ethanol, agarose. Other consumables are ordered as needed; each person must keep track of the amount of these consumables they are using and report that use on a spreadsheet in each lab. The consumables that are ordered on a per-use basis include:

1. Pipette tips
2. DNA extraction kits
3. XXX

### Lab SOPs

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) exist for several lab protocols that are typically carried out in the MERLab. These include:

1. DNA Extraction using DNEasy blood and tissue extraction kits
2. PCR amplification
3. Metabarcode library preparation
4. AMPure bead clean-up
5. MinElute DNA purification and gel purification
6. Sanger sequencing

All lab SOPs, as well as SOPs for chemical and equipment found in the lab, can be found in the W.A.D.E. lab's [Genetic Lab SOPs folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/180tIs4EQgK9JZVMmZvN0ap2sO8C149bk?usp=sharing).

## MERLab Etiquette {-}

-	With the exception of standard household cleaning supplies (windex, all purpose cleaner, soap etc) or 10% bleach and 95% EtOH for bench cleaning, all chemicals should be stored in the approprate chemical storage either under the fume hood or in the chemical storage lab bench.

-	All portable lab equipment (e.g. PCR racks, glassware) that has been used must be soaked for at least 10 minutes in 10% bleach, rinsed in DI water, and left out to air dry. Within several hours or the following day, return lab equipment to it's storage location.

- Non-portable lab equipment (e.g. centrifuge, PCR machines, vortexers, tube spinners) should be wiped with 10% bleach and 95% EtOH if any DNA extract or amplification project comes in contact with this equipment. Additionally, equipment should be wiped with 10% bleach and 95% EtOH every 2-3 months.

-	Keep lab counter spaces clear of clutter. Return all lab equipment and chemicals that are not actively being used to their proper storage locations. Before and after using a lab bench, thoroughly wipe the bench and pipettes with 10% bleach followed by 95% EtOH.

-	Follow this general guideline: "leave it as clean or cleaner than you found it."

-	Unless otherwise marked, all supplies and equipment in the lab are communal.

-	Never store samples or chemicals outside of the lab.

-	All samples placed in the freezer should be labeled with a date, sample contents, name of project, and the person responsible for the samples.

- At the end of a specific lab project, review all intermediate products stored in the fridge and freezer spaces and determine what, if anything, should be stored long-term. Throw out any unneeded intermediate products. Contact the MERLab or W.A.D.E. Lab PIs to discuss long-term storage of products that you wish to keep.

- Periodically conduct checks of the fridge and freezer spaces to ensure that you've removed any unneeded products, and that all of your products are appropriately labeled and stored in the proper location (e.g. on your shelf, clearly labeled with your name).
