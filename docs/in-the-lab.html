Please read this entire page carefully before scheduling an in-person orientation with Amy.</p>
<p>Once you have completed the online training courses and the in-person orientation to the MERLab spaces, please complete and sign the UW <a href="https://www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/lab-employee-safety-train-checklist.docx">Lab Employee Safety Training Record</a>, and email a copy to Amy.</p>

<p>While working in the MERLab, you may come in contact with potentially harmful chemicals. These include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>EtOH (ethanol):</strong> Ethanol may be found in dilutions of 100%, 95%, or 70%. 100% ethanol is flammable and can be an irritant to the eyes or skin. It can also affect the respiratory tract if breathed for a long period of time. Safety information for ethanol can be found <a href="https://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/89308.htm">here</a>. If you come in contact with ethanol, rinse the affected area thoroughly (e.g. eyewash station for eyes or soap and water on skin). Store 100% ethanol in the chemical storage cabinet beneath the north fume hood in MAR 276. Ethanol can be disposed of by pouring down the sink while diluting with plenty of running water.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bleach:</strong> Bleach may be found in dilutions of 100% or ~10%. 100% bleash is corrosive and can cause eye and skin burns. It is also harmful if inhaled. Safety information for bleach can by found <a href="https://fscimage.fishersci.com/msds/91020.htm">here</a>. If you come in contact with ethanol, rinse the affected area thoroughly (e.g. eyewash station for eyes or soap and water on skin).

<p>The MERLab is divided into three main areas to minimize contamination: (1) a DNA extraction lab (MAR 271), (2) a pre-PCR lab (MAR 276), and (3) a post-PCR lab (MAR 277). Genetic material should only move in the direction 1-2-3 and never backwards. Once genetic material has left the pre-PCR lab, for example, it can only go to the post-PCR lab and never return to the DNA extraction lab or pre-PCR lab.</p>

<p>The MERLab is run as a cost center, which allows its member labs to combine orders and reduce waste and additional expenses. The use of certain consumables is covered by a monthly fee to the MERLab; e.g. gloves, ethanol, agarose. Other consumables are ordered as needed; each person must keep track of the amount of these consumables they are using and report that use on a spreadsheet in each lab. The consumables that are ordered on a per-use basis include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>With the exception of standard household cleaning supplies (windex, all purpose cleaner, soap etc) or 10% bleach and 95% EtOH for bench cleaning, all chemicals should be stored in the approprate chemical storage either under the fume hood or in the chemical storage lab bench.</p></li>
<li><p>All portable lab equipment (e.g. PCR racks, glassware) that has been used must be soaked for at least 10 minutes in 10% bleach, rinsed in DI water, and left out to air dry. Within several hours or the following day, return lab equipment to it’s storage location.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-portable lab equipment (e.g. centrifuge, PCR machines, vortexers, tube spinners) should be wiped with 10% bleach and 95% EtOH if any DNA extract or amplification project comes in contact with this equipment. Additionally, equipment should be wiped with 10% bleach and 95% EtOH every 2-3 months.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep lab counter spaces clear of clutter. Return all lab equipment and chemicals that are not actively being used to their proper storage locations. Before and after using a lab bench, thoroughly wipe the bench and pipettes with 10% bleach followed by 95% EtOH.</p></li>
<li><p>Follow this general guideline: “leave it as clean or cleaner than you found it.”</p></li>
<li><p>Unless otherwise marked, all supplies and equipment in the lab are communal.</p></li>
<li><p>Never store samples or chemicals outside of the lab.</p></li>
<li><p>All samples placed in the freezer should be labeled with a date, sample contents, name of project, and the person responsible for the samples.</p></li>
<li><p>At the end of a specific lab project, review all intermediate products stored in the fridge and freezer spaces and determine what, if anything, should be stored long-term. Throw out any unneeded intermediate products. Contact the MERLab or W.A.D.E. Lab PIs to discuss long-term storage of products that you wish to keep.</p></li>
<li><p>Periodically conduct checks of the fridge and freezer spaces to ensure that you’ve removed any unneeded products, and that all of your products are appropriately labeled and stored in the proper location (e.g. on your shelf, clearly labeled with your name).</p></li>
