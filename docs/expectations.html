<p>Amy serves as a mentor and source of information about academics, research, service, and life in general. She will do her best to help everyone get the most out of their experience at SAFS and UW. Amy will push you to be your best self, which may include some uncomfortable conversations on occasion. Maintaining open and clear lines of communication will be paramount to our successful mentor/mentee relationship. As such, Amy believes strongly that students, postdocs, and technicians should feel empowered to openly express their feelings.</p>
<p>Although Amy is committed to helping you find the resources and information you need, she’s also cisgendered, straight, and white, which means some of you may want to seek advice from others inside or outside of SAFS. If you should choose to do so, you are under no obligation to tell Amy about it.</p>

<p>Post-docs in our lab conduct independent research and serve as <em>ad hoc</em> advisors to undergraduate and graduate students. They are a useful source of information and can help students navigate difficult situations.</p>

<p>All postdocs will undergo an annual review with Amy, as required under the collective bargaining agreement. Prior to the meeting, Amy (and potentially other collaborators) will fill out <a href="resources/postdoc_360.docx">this form</a>. The postdoc will fill out <a href="resources/postdoc_annual_activities.docx">this form</a>. After the meeting, Amy will send the completed forms to the HR director and they will file them away.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Undergraduates<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#undergraduates"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Undergraduate research experiences are an important part of setting people up for success in future scientific endeavors, especially if they are interested in attending graduate school. Our lab employs undergraduate technicians for lab and field work, and we also sponsor undergraduate students working on their senior capstone projects in <a href="https://fish.uw.edu/students/undergraduate-program/degree-overview-new/undergraduate-capstone-project/">SAFS</a> and the <a href="https://envstudies.uw.edu/capstone-experience/">Program on the Environment</a>. If you’re an undergraduate working with our lab group, it’s important that you understand the background and rationale for your project. Could you explain it equally as effectively to both Amy and your parent(s)?</p>
<p>Here are some additional expectations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We expect people working with us to be on time, so let us know ASAP if something comes up and you cannot be somewhere at a pre-specified time.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell us if you break or lose something, which tends to happen from time to time and is a normal part of research. Your first concern should be for your safety and for those around you. Once you’re sure everyone is OK, assess the situation and get help as needed. <strong>If there is any sort of emergency, call 911 immediately</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>We expect people to work the hours they’re being paid. You may not do homework, read material unrelated to the lab, eat lunch, etc while being paid by us. You are welcome to use the lab space as a place to sit while you work on other tasks, though.</p></li>
<li><p>Please clean up after yourself. The lab is a shared space and we do not want to suffer a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of the commons</a>. If you don’t know where something belongs, ask for help.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Work hours<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#work-hours"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Everyone is expected to work 40 hours a week and to finish their tasks on time, but there are no fixed hours when people are expected to be working in the office, lab, or remote location. That said, there will indeed be times when you are expected to be somewhere at a certain time, whether it be for a meeting, seminar, or lab/field work. Please be considerate of other people’s time and do not make them wait for you or wonder where you are. If something should come up, please contact others to let them know your status.</p>
<p><em>Remote Work:</em> COVID has taught us much about the benefits and limitations of remote work. Amy encourages remote work to the extent that it facilitates each lab member’s personal productivity. However, Amy also recognizes that building and maintaining a professional network is important at every career stage, and that collaborative professional relationships improve the quality of everyone’s scientific products. Amy expects that all of the members of the UW W.A.D.E Lab will work in the lab at least 3 days per week, in order to provide each lab member with <em>ad hoc</em> opportunities to form and maintain professional relationships within the SAFS and UW academic communities.</p>
<p>In general, Amy tries to maintain core hours at SAFS from 11:00-4:00 Monday-Thursday, so that people can interact with her on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis. When Amy knows she will be away due to travel or other business, she will do her best to alert the lab prior to her absence. If you cannot find Amy in her office, please send her a message via email or text message (if urgent or an emergency). You can also set up a one-off meeting with her using her <a href="https://calendar.app.google/6S7FAok44L6n2TpF7">meeting scheduler</a>.</p>
<p>If you are funded as an RA or TA, you are expected to work on the research program funding you, or the class to which you have been assigned, for 20 hours per week. You are expected to spend another 20 hours per week working on your own research, coursework, outreach, etc. “Side projects” are encouraged, but they should be considered part of your own 20 hours of research/studies, and not your RA or TA responsibilities. Your highest priorities are completing the tasks related to your TA/RA work and making progress towards completing your degree.</p>

<p><em>Everyone</em> in the lab is entitled to some time off from work. No one is expected to work on the following holidays:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Year’s Day (January 1)<br>
</li>
<li>Martin Luther King, Jr. Day (third Monday in January)<br>

<p>Grad students with a 50% or greater FTE appointment for twelve months are allowed 4 weeks (20 business days) of paid time off per year, but they should clear any leave plans with Amy at least 2 weeks in advance. There will be no reduction in pay or benefits for this time off. Grad students with a 50% appointment for less than twelve months, or those who are appointed for less than 50% FTE, shall have vacation time off prorated on this basis.</p>
<p>Grad students who are employed as a 50% FTE for three or more quarters during the 12-month period starting September 16th shall be entitled to one personal holiday during that 12-month period (this applies to most students). Personal holidays must be requested in advance. Grad students are also eligible for paid sick leave, which accrues at one (1) hour for every 40 hours worked. Sick leave accrues at the end of the month and is available for use the following month.</p>

For appointment periods of less than one year, postdocs will receive the prorated number of paid vacation days. Unused vacation time off shall lapse 12 months from the date it was received and at the expiration of each appointment period. Unused vacation time off is not paid at separation, does not transfer between employment programs, and is not eligible for shared leave donation.</p>
<p>Postdocs receive one day of paid sick time off for every month of their appointment. Paid sick time off will be preloaded annually and available at the beginning of the month following the start of the appointment. Up to 12 days of unused sick time off will carry forward to the next appointment year. Note, however, that unused sick time off is not paid at separation, does not transfer between employment programs, and is not eligible for shared leave donation.</p>

<p><em>Everyone</em> in the lab is responsible for letting Amy know if you will be away for an extended period of time, whether it be a personal vacation or for field work. If it’s just a day off here or there, it’s not a problem, but Amy and others would like to know ahead of time if you are likely to be difficult to get a hold of should we need to for any reason. We genuinely care about the well being of one another, so if you are absent for more than 2 days without notifying anyone, we will reach out to your emergency contact(s) to verify you are safe and well.</p>
