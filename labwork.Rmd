# W.A.D.E. Lab Genetics Program

The W.A.D.E. Lab shares genetics laboratory space with the SAFS MERLab, which is jointly run by Drs. [Lorenz Hauser](https://fish.uw.edu/faculty/lorenz-hauser/) ([Marine Population Genomics Lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/lhauser/wordpress/)) and [Kerry Naish](https://fish.uw.edu/faculty/kerry-naish/)([Applied Evolutionary and Ecological Genetics Lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/knaish/)). The lab occupies rooms 271, 276, and 277 on the second floor of the Marine Studies building ([MAR](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Marine+Studies+Building+(MAR)/@47.6525504,-122.3156089,19z/data=!3m1!5s0x549014f1fcfb9d01:0xc96981eca3b78cce!4m6!3m5!1s0x549014f1fced4987:0xc612428a54e06427!8m2!3d47.6524713!4d-122.314939!16s%2Fg%2F1hm4zq649?entry=ttu))

## Genetics Lab Orientation and Safety Training

Any member of the W.A.D.E. Lab who uses the genetics laboratory facilities must first complete a lab orientation and safety training, consisting of an in-person walk-through of the lab spaces and several online training courses. Please read the following information carefully before the in-person orientation:  

### Online Training Courses

## General etiquette and advice

-	With the exception of standard household cleaning supplies (windex, all purpose cleaner, soap etc) all chemicals should be stored in the fume hood, or in the chemical storage under the fume hood.

- In order to help keep the fume hood relatively unobstructed: only chemicals that are being used should be in the actual fume hood, with storage of extra supplies under the hood in the cabinets.

-	Wash all equipment that has been used and leave out to dry. 

-	Keep lab counter spaces clear of clutter. 

-	Follow this general guideline: "leave it as clean or cleaner than you found it"

-	Unless otherwise marked, all supplies and equipment in the lab are communal

-	Never store samples or chemicals outside of the lab.

-	All samples placed in the freezer should be labeled with a date, sample contents, and name of project or person responsible.
